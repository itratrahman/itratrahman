* Built and deployed blink-based liveness/spoof detection and integrated into Android via TensorFlow Lite + Kotlin, achieving >99% accuracy on video samples.
* Delivered a face verification service (Tensorflow, FastAPI, Docker, AWS Lambda) to confirm whether two photos belong to the same person, reaching 97% accuracy on a large photo-pair corpus.
* Automated route optimization by pulling merchant locations (Google Maps) and generating short-distance routes, saving ~$500–$700 per area plus hundreds of manual hours.
* Reduced manual NID image review by ~400 hours across 200K images using CV quality checks + clustering/z-score threshold tuning.
* Built AutoML forecasting for hourly/daily payment gateway volumes; automated retraining/forecasting with Vertex AI + BigQuery and validated campaign lift with A/B testing, contributing to ~7% usage increases during campaign seasons.
* Implemented a fraud detection service (MySQL geospatial search + FastAPI) to flag merchant name/location manipulation and alert CRM apps in near real time.
* Engineered a distributed pipeline processing 100M log rows/month (MySQL → unified profiles in MongoDB → tokenized BigQuery tables via Dataflow), accelerating phases 6x–30x via Dask, concurrency, and indexing; automated runs with cron. The pipeline forms the bedrock of all the analytics work done at SSL Wireless.
